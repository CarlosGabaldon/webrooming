## Webrooming

A platform for retailers that combines online channels and brick-and-mortar retail opportunities. But instead of viewing products in-store and purchasing them online, webrooming consumers research products online before visiting a brick-and-mortar store for final evaluation and purchase.

 Consumers expect the ability to shop easily across many different channels, and they allow the web and mobile channels to influence their buying decisions — regardless of how (or where) they eventually purchase the product.


Shoppers expect the customer experience to be continuous across all channels. The webrooming platform allows retailers to take advantage of this trend by expanding consumers’ access to information online, while retaining control over the customer journey by emphasizing brick-and-mortar as the customer’s final destination.
